# 🚇 Metro Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project demonstrates the practical use of **Dijkstra's Algorithm** on the **Bengaluru Metro network (Green & Purple Lines)**.

The application computes the optimal route between metro stations and visually displays the journey in a clean, interactive web interface.

##  Project Overview

- The metro network is modeled as a **graph** using an adjacency matrix.
- Each station represents a **node**.
- Each direct connection represents an **edge**.
- The system computes:

  -  Shortest path (minimum stations)  
  -  Minimum interchange route  
  -  Estimated travel time  
  -  Number of interchanges  

---

## Key Features

-  Smart station auto-suggestions  
-  Shortest path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm  
-  Minimum interchange optimization  
-  Color-coded metro lines (Green & Purple)  
-  Smooth animated route visualization  
-  Responsive modern UI  
-  Fully deployed on GitHub Pages

##  Algorithm Used

**Dijkstra's Algorithm**

The algorithm calculates the minimum distance from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

Time Complexity:
O(V²) (Adjacency Matrix implementation)
